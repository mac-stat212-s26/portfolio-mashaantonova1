This TidyTuesday dataset is curated from the CNPJ open data and cleaned to focus on firms with meaningful declared capital stock, retaining only companies above a capital threshold.\nDeclared capital stock represents the financial capital formally reported by a firm and serves as a proxy for economic scale. Companies are categorized by size and legal form, and the dataset also includes information on owner qualifications. This allows us to examine not only which companies hold the highest capital but also how ownership roles and organizational structure relate to capital distribution.\nBecause the dataset excludes very low-capital firms and capital stock is highly right-skewed, this analysis uses logarithmic scaling and distribution-based visualizations to avoid misleading comparisons. The goal is descriptive: to examine patterns of capital concentration across firm types, ownership, and legal structure.",

    "section": "Summary / Data Story",
    "text": "Summary / Data Story\nOur analysis explores how access to high levels of declared capital is structured across Brazilian firms, focusing on the roles of ownership and legal form.\nWho controls the capital? The main visualization shows the distribution of owner qualifications in elite (top 10% by capital) versus typical companies. While Managing Partners dominate most firms, elite companies reveal a more diverse leadership composition: Administrators and Managers lead roughly 30% of elite firms compared to under 9% in typical firms, and positions like Directors, Officers, and Presidents are also far more common at the top. This indicates that the highest-capital firms adopt more formalized corporate governance structures, suggesting ownership type is strongly associated with access to substantial capital.\nHow does legal structure shape capital within small enterprises? Because capital stock is highly right-skewed, values were placed on a log10 scale for meaningful comparison and to avoid the largest firms dominating the plot. The supporting boxplot examines capital stock across legal forms among small enterprises. While most legal categories show similar median capital levels, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) display a wider distribution and longer right tail, indicating that some LLCs hold much higher capital than their peers. Simpler forms, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships, tend to have narrower ranges and fewer extreme values. This suggests that while legal form does not completely determine capital, it can create opportunities for higher capital accumulation within certain structures.\nKey insight: Taken together, these findings suggest that access to high capital in Brazil is structured more by ownership role and organizational form than by formal size classification. Elite capital is concentrated in firms with diverse, professionalized leadership and in legal structures (especially LLCs) that allow for greater financial leverage. Entrepreneurs and policymakers should be aware that both governance and legal framework influence which firms can access the highest levels of capital.",

Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot().

Using the class() function we can check the class (type) of object that we just read in. Note the presence of the “sf” and “data.frame” classes:\n\nCodeclass(nc)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_cities)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\nCodeclass(mn_water)\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nWhen we read in spatial objects, it is useful to check what CRS underlies the data. We can do that with st_crs() from the sf package:\n\nCodest_crs(nc)\n\nCoordinate Reference System:\n  User input: NAD27 \n  wkt:\nGEOGCRS[\"NAD27\",\n    DATUM[\"North American Datum 1927\",\n        ELLIPSOID[\"Clarke 1866\",6378206.4,294.978698213898,\n            LENGTHUNIT[\"metre\",1]]],\n    PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,\n        ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    CS[ellipsoidal,2],\n        AXIS[\"latitude\",north,\n            ORDER[1],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n        AXIS[\"longitude\",east,\n            ORDER[2],\n            ANGLEUNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433]],\n    ID[\"EPSG\",4267]]\n\n\nWe can treat sf objects similarly to ordinary datasets when using ggplot2 to make spatial visualizations:\n\nCodeggplot(nc) +\n    geom_sf() +\n    theme_classic() +\n    labs(title = \"NAD27\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChange CRS\n\nLet’s explore how changing the CRS changes the map. The st_transform() function in sf re-expresses a spatial object using a user-supplied CRS. The crs argument takes a string descriptor of the CRS. We can find these descriptors via https://epsg.io.

map where city locations are overlaid on a map of county boundaries.\n\n\nYou will need to call geom_sf() twice.\nMake the map background white.\nInstall the ggthemes package, and add the following layer to use a clean map theme: + ggthemes::theme_map()\n\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities, size = 0.5) +\n    ggthemes::theme_map()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomize Colors\n\nWe can use traditional ggplot2 aesthetics (e.g., fill, color) to display location specific attributes. Below we only plot large cities, and we color and size cities according to their population.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = \"white\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\") # move legend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook up the scale_color_viridis_c() documentation via the ggplot2 reference.\n\nRead the function description at the top. What is the advantage of using this function for making color palettes?\nLook through the examples section. What is the difference between the _d(), _c(), and _b() variants of this function?\n\nThe viridis color scale results in plots that can be interpreted analogously whether in color or black and white and is color-blind friendly.\n\nThe _d() variant is used when color is mapped to a discrete (categorical) variable.\nThe _c() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable.\nThe _b() variant is used when color is mapped to a continuous variable but when we want that continuous variable to be binned so that there is a small set of colors.\nAdding Elevation Raster Data\nWhere are large cities located? Is there some relationship to local geography/terrain?\n\nTo investigate these questions, we can obtain elevation data to include on the map using the elevatr package. We encounter two new functions here—we can look up their documentation to make sense of the code by entering the following in the Console:\n\n\n?elevatr::get_elev_raster\n?terra::as.data.frame\n\n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties, z = 5, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nBuild on our existing map by adding a raster layer for elevation as the background.\n\nLook up the documentation for geom_raster() to plot the elevation data from elev_df. This will be the first layer of the plot.\nLook at the documentation for scale_fill_gradient() to add the following elevation color scale: \"darkgreen\" represents the lowest elevations, and \"white\" represents the highest elevations.\nAdd in the layers from the map above to show the largest cities and the county outlines. To remove a background color, use fill = NA.\n\n\nCodeggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) +\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\", guide = FALSE) +\n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population))+\n    scale_color_viridis_c() + \n    labs(title = \"Minnesota Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZoom in to Twin Cities and Add Water\n\nThe bulk of the interesting information in this map is in the Twin Cities area. Let’s zoom in to this area.\n\n\nWe can use the st_bbox() function to get the bounding box for a spatial object—we do this after filtering to the 7 counties in the Twin Cities.\nWe then use st_crop() to trim a spatial object to a given bounding box.\n\n\nCodeseven_countyarea &lt;- mn_counties |&gt;\n    filter(name %in% c(\"Anoka\", \"Hennepin\", \"Ramsey\", \"Dakota\", \"Carver\", \"Washington\", \"Scott\")) |&gt; \n    st_bbox()\nseven_countyarea\n\n     xmin      ymin      xmax      ymax \n 419967.1 4924212.8  521254.8 5029157.4 \n\nCodeelevation &lt;- elevatr::get_elev_raster(mn_counties |&gt; st_crop(seven_countyarea), z = 9, clip = \"bbox\")\nraster::crs(elevation) &lt;- sf::st_crs(mn_counties)\n\n# Convert to data frame for plotting\nelev_df &lt;- elevation |&gt; terra::as.data.frame(xy = TRUE)\ncolnames(elev_df) &lt;- c(\"x\", \"y\", \"elevation\")\n\n\nIn the plot below, we add a layer for water information and a coord_sf() layer to restrict the x and y-axis limits to the Twin Cities bounding box. (Without this layer, the map would zoom back out to show all counties and bodies of water).\n\nCodepng(\"../figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 800, height = 500)\nggplot() +\n    geom_raster(data = elev_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = elevation)) + \n    geom_sf(data = mn_counties, fill = NA, color = \"black\") + # county boundary layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_water, fill = \"lightsteelblue1\", color = \"lightsteelblue1\") + # NEW: river/lake layer\n    geom_sf(data = mn_cities |&gt; filter(Population &gt;= 10000), mapping = aes(color = Population, size = Population)) + # cities layer\n    scale_color_viridis_c(option = \"magma\") + # continuous (gradient) color scale\n    scale_fill_gradient(low = \"darkgreen\", high = \"white\") + # continuous (gradient) fill scale\n    coord_sf(xlim = seven_countyarea[c(\"xmin\", \"xmax\")], ylim = seven_countyarea[c(\"ymin\", \"ymax\")]) + # NEW: crop map to Twin Cities bounding box\n    labs(title = \"Twin Cities with Population &gt;= 10,000\") + \n    ggthemes::theme_map() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") # remove legend\ndev.off()\n\nquartz_off_screen \n                2 \n\n\nLet’s add to the above code chunk to save the map above to an image file called tc_map_zoom.png in the figures folder. The code example below shows a general template for saving a plot to file. Choose a reasonable width and height. (There are also jpeg() and pdf() functions for writing images.)\n\nCode# png(\"../figures/tc_map_zoom.png\", width = 800, height = 500)\n# # Code for creating plot\n# dev.off()",
