This TidyTuesday dataset is curated from the CNPJ open data and cleaned to focus on firms with meaningful declared capital stock, retaining only companies above a capital threshold.\nDeclared capital stock represents the financial capital formally reported by a firm and serves as a proxy for economic scale. Companies are categorized by size and legal form, and the dataset also includes information on owner qualifications. This allows us to examine not only which companies hold the highest capital but also how ownership roles and organizational structure relate to capital distribution.\nBecause the dataset excludes very low-capital firms and capital stock is highly right-skewed, this analysis uses logarithmic scaling and distribution-based visualizations to avoid misleading comparisons. The goal is descriptive: to examine patterns of capital concentration across firm types, ownership, and legal structure.",

    "section": "Summary / Data Story",
    "text": "Summary / Data Story\nOur analysis explores how access to high levels of declared capital is structured across Brazilian firms, focusing on the roles of ownership and legal form.\nWho controls the capital? The main visualization shows the distribution of owner qualifications in elite (top 10% by capital) versus typical companies. While Managing Partners dominate most firms, elite companies reveal a more diverse leadership composition: Administrators and Managers lead roughly 30% of elite firms compared to under 9% in typical firms, and positions like Directors, Officers, and Presidents are also far more common at the top. This indicates that the highest-capital firms adopt more formalized corporate governance structures, suggesting ownership type is strongly associated with access to substantial capital.\nHow does legal structure shape capital within small enterprises? Because capital stock is highly right-skewed, values were placed on a log10 scale for meaningful comparison and to avoid the largest firms dominating the plot. The supporting boxplot examines capital stock across legal forms among small enterprises. While most legal categories show similar median capital levels, Limited Liability Companies (LLCs) display a wider distribution and longer right tail, indicating that some LLCs hold much higher capital than their peers. Simpler forms, such as sole proprietorships and partnerships, tend to have narrower ranges and fewer extreme values. This suggests that while legal form does not completely determine capital, it can create opportunities for higher capital accumulation within certain structures.\nKey insight: Taken together, these findings suggest that access to high capital in Brazil is structured more by ownership role and organizational form than by formal size classification. Elite capital is concentrated in firms with diverse, professionalized leadership and in legal structures (especially LLCs) that allow for greater financial leverage. Entrepreneurs and policymakers should be aware that both governance and legal framework influence which firms can access the highest levels of capital.",

Let’s look at the geom_point documentation page to learn how to read a documentation page..\nThe Usage section shows all of the possible inputs (arguments) to the geom. These are all of the ways that a geom can be customized. Just looking at the argument names can help give a hint as to what arguments might fit our needs.\nThe Arguments section, on the other hand, explains in detail what each argument does and the possible values the argument can take. The mapping, data, and ... arguments will be the most commonly used by far.\n\n\nmapping is the argument that is being used when we specify which variables should link or map to the plot aesthetics (the code inside aes()).\n\ndata is the argument where we specify the dataset containing the variables that the geom is using.\n\n... is used for fixed aesthetics (ones that don’t correspond to a variable), eg, to set the color of all points, we use color = \"red\" and to set the size of all points, we use size = 3.\n\nThe Aesthetics section of a geom documentation page gives information on how the visual elements of the geom correspond to data. For example, the geom_point documentation page shows that x and y aesthetics are available. It also shows some new aesthetics like stroke.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotedata Argument\n\n\n\nPreviously you have used one dataset per plot by specifying that as the first argument of ggplot().
